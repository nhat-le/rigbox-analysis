77,10/15/21,F29,frontal,5.75,3.7,184,"manually switched sides at block 3, ended fairly early, random bursts of fast movements with frozenness especially in block 4/5"
78,10/26/21,F26,frontal,6.8,3.69,386,"did well, performed many blocks"
79,10/26/21,F27,frontal,6.8,3.7,429,Started out a little biased to the right (slow switching on the left); switching is a bit slow in general but good performance overall (stayed motivated)
80,10/26/21,F29,frontal,6.8,3.7,393,"GREAT performance. Likes to have some random switching in the middle of the block (usually during a left block). When rotating to left, likes to use one hand for rotating but uses both hands for a right turn"
81,10/27/21,F27,motor,6.1,3.66,224,"Laser spot as wide radius (reflection?), animal put in machine, taken out, put in again (<1hr before starting)"
82,10/27/21,F29,motor,6.1,3.66,263,Extremely good performance
83,10/27/21,F26,motor,6.1,3.66,442,"started out good behavior, then got noisier towards the end, ended first session (60% opto) and ran another session without any opto"
84,10/28/21,F29,visual,6.1,3.64,265,
85,10/28/21,F26,visual,6.1,3.64,420,"2nd session had an overall worse performance than first session (3 non-opto blocks, baseline)"
86,10/28/21,F27,visual,6.1,3.64,251,A little biased to the left when we started so did 4 base blocks with no opto. 2nd session also began with 4 non-opto blocks. Stopped being motivated pretty soon
87,10/29/21,F26,rsc,6.5,3.65,263,"Second session started out a little better than 3 base blocks, got demotivated quickly. Not a lot of opto blocks. Maybe needs a break from opto; Seemed agitated during 5th block, demotivated fast"
88,10/29/21,F27,rsc,6.5,3.65,227,"Overall great performance, demotivated very quickly"
89,10/29/21,F29,rsc,6.5,3.65,312,"Great performance!! Effects are subtle, if any"
96,11/01/21,F26,frontal,13,4.49,349,"Longer than usual set up time, blocks 6/7/8 different behavior, switched back to good behavior on non-opto"
97,11/01/21,F27,frontal,13,4.49,286,most of blocks are opto blocks. block 3 is interesting 
98,11/01/21,F29,frontal,13,4.49,248,"good switching behavior but stopped earlier than usual, opto effect was apparent"
102,11/03/21,F27,motor,13.1,4.53,198,demotivated very early on in session
103,11/03/21,F29,motor,13.1,4.53,277,animal may be moved during exp so 10 points that we choose may not be motor cortex
104,11/03/21,F26,motor,13.1,4.53,353,"great performance, almost 16 blocks, opto may have some effects"
108,11/05/21,F29,visual,12.5,4.59,300,Not the best performance
109,11/05/21,F26,visual,12.5,4.59,357,Not the best performance
110,11/05/21,F27,visual,12.5,4.59,256,First 5 blocks or so really great performance; but got demotivated very quickly
114,11/07/21,F26,rsc,13.1,4.25,338,"Okay performance, manually set 4 non-opto blocks as baseline"
115,11/07/21,F27,rsc,13.1,4.25,269,"Long non-opto block in session 2, demotivated quickly"
116,11/07/21,F29,rsc,13.1,4.25,277,"good performance in non-opto blocks, some errors during early opto blocks and more errors in late opto blocks"
120,11/09/21,F27,frontal,6.5,3.44,283,"Interesting first non-opto block, fairly slow switching throughout"
121,11/09/21,F29,frontal,6.5,3.44,294,good performance
122,11/09/21,F26,frontal,6.5,3.44,406,"Good performance, opto blocks skewed to right. Behavior initially biased to the right but then gradually biased to the left"
129,11/12/21,F29,motor,6.6,3.33,208,"Demotivated very early (maybe because so much water is rewarded at start since so accurate), first 8 blocks really good"
130,11/12/21,F26,motor,6.6,3.33,335,"Bias to one side, doesn't give up easily, performance just weakens"
131,11/12/21,F27,motor,6.6,3.33,297,Stress from beginning (we had to change the tube) may have contributed to poor performance
135,11/14/21,F26,visual,6.7,3.3,447,Really great performance
136,11/14/21,F27,visual,6.7,3.3,234 + 2 more baselines before restart,Great performance considering that it was on the wheel for a long time while we restarted the computer.
137,11/14/21,F29,visual,6.7,3.3,236,Great performance. Stopped very quickly
141,11/16/21,F27,visual,6.5,3.45,183,"Inflamation observed in the posterior part of the brain, very few errors"
142,11/16/21,F29,visual,6.5,3.45,227,good performance
143,11/16/21,F26,rsc,6.5,3.45,545,Really persistent. Seems to be an effect
147,11/18/21,F29,rsc,6.7,3.59,281,"good performance, stops fairly early"
148,11/18/21,F26,rsc,6.7,3.59,356,good performance
149,11/18/21,F27,rsc,6.7,3.59,397,good performance
153,11/20/21,F26,motor,6.8,3.45,410,Really good performance. But way more opto blocks than anticipated
154,11/20/21,F27,visual,6.8,3.45,270,Pretty good performance!
155,11/20/21,F29,rsc,6.8,3.45,341,Pretty good performance!
